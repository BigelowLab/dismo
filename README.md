## Installation

`dismo` is available from CRAN, so you can use `install.packages("dismo")` to get the current *released version*

The easiest way to use the *development version* on Windows or MacOS, is to install it from the [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/organizations/), like this:


```
install.packages('dismo', repos='https://rspatial.r-universe.dev')
```
